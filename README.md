# Flutter PubNub Plugin

A cross platform plugin for implementing real time messaging applications using PubNub (https://www.pubnub.com/).
This plugin is not provided nor supported by PubNub. It was implemented part of a real time messaging application developed by Ingenio (https://www.ingenio.com/).

## Features

* Multi client support allowing to handle messaging and presence from multiple PubNub clients defined in the PubNub environment.
* Auth key handling
* Filter expression handling
* Presence capabilities
* Publish and Subscribe/Unsubscribe capabilities
* Status 
* Error handling

**IMPORTANT NOTES**:

* The plugin can only be used on iOS and Android and not supported on Flutter Web. In order to support Web, Desktop and mobile platforms, PubNub would have to create a Flutter plugin that directly accesses their low level REST API.

## Getting Started

The plugin follows as much as possible the naming conventions PubNub exposes via their respective iOS and Android SDK.

First, in the pubspec.yaml file, import the plugin as:

### Add dependency

```yaml
dependencies:
  pubnub_flutter:: ^0.0.1  #latest version
```

## Easy setup

```dart
import 'package:flutter_pubnub/pubnub.dart';


final PubNub _client = PubNub(PubNubConfig('pub-c-xxxx', 'sub-cxxx'));

```

The PubNubConfig constructor allows to pass a PubNub auth key, presence timeout in seconds, a filter expression and finally a UUID (note a default UUID is generated if not provided)

```dart

PubNubConfig(this.publishKey, this.subscribeKey, {this.authKey, this.presenceTimeout, this.uuid, this.filter});

```

## Clients

Creating one or more clients with PubNub subscribe and publish keys

```dart

// Note that the proper key values for PubNub are found in the client configuration dashboard under your PubNub account
final PubNub _client1 = PubNub(PubNubConfig('pub-c-xxxx', 'sub-cxxx'));
final PubNub _client2 = PubNub(PubNubConfig('pub-c-yyyy', 'sub-cyyy'));

```

Creating a client with a PubNub auth key

```dart

// Note that the proper key values for PubNub are found in the client configuration dashboard under your PubNub account
final PubNub _client = PubNub(PubNubConfig('pub-c-xxxx', 'sub-cxxx', authKey: 'auth-xxxx'));

```

Creating a client with a UUID

```dart

// Note that the proper key values for PubNub are found in the client configuration dashboard under your PubNub account
final PubNub _client = PubNub(PubNubConfig('pub-c-xxxx', 'sub-cxxx', uuid: '127c1ab5-fc7f-4c46-8460-3207b6782007'));

```

Creating a client with a presence timeout in seconds

```dart

// Note that the proper key values for PubNub are found in the client configuration dashboard under your PubNub account
final PubNub _client = PubNub(PubNubConfig('pub-c-xxxx', 'sub-cxxx', presenceTimeout: 120));

```

Creating a client with a filter expression

```dart

// The filter expression here is done, as an example on the uuid, so any messages sent from the client with that UUID will not be received in the subscribe method
final PubNub _client = PubNub(PubNubConfig('pub-c-xxxx', 'sub-cxxx', filter: 'uuid != "127c1ab5-fc7f-4c46-8460-3207b6782007"'));

```

Then in order to publish a message with the proper metadata that will trigger the filtering

```dart

// The filter expression here is done, as an example on the uuid, so any messages sent from the client with that UUID will not be received in the subscribe method
_client.publish('Test-Channel1', {'message': 'Hello World'},
               metadata: {
                'uuid': '127c1ab5-fc7f-4c46-8460-3207b6782007'
                }
              );

```

## Retrieve the client UUID

In some cases, especially when the UUID is not setup during client creation, it can be helpful getting the UUID that was automatically generated by PubNub.

```dart

_client.uuid().then((uuid) => print('UUID: $uuid'));

```

## Channels

A client can subscribe to one or many channels. It can also unsubscribe from one or many/all channels

```dart

 _client.subscribe(['Test-Channel1', 'Test-Channel1']);

 _client.unsubscribe('Test-Channel1');
 
 _client.unsubscribeAll();

```


## Publishing

A client can publish messages to one channel

```dart

 _client.publish(('Test-Channel1', {'message': 'Hello World!'});

```

As previously described, if a filter has been set and if we need to react to it, metadata related to the configured filter must be passed during publication.

```dart

_client.publish('Test-Channel1', {'message': 'Hello World'},
               metadata: {
                'uuid': '127c1ab5-fc7f-4c46-8460-3207b6782007'
                }
              );

```

## Presence

A client can respond to presence events generated by PubNub (client disconnection, ...) but can also send custom presence events

```dart
_client.presence('Test-Channel1', {'state': 'busy'});

```

## Subscriptions

In order to build a chat service for example, the client does not only send messages but must also consume messages, be aware if the client on the other end disconnected, status.

``` dart

_client.onStatusReceived.listen((status) => print('Status:${status.toString()}'));

_client.onPresenceReceived.listen((presence) => print('Presence:${presence.toString()}'));

_client.onMessageReceived.listen((message) => print('Message:$message'));

_client.onErrorReceived.listen((error) => print('Error:$error'));

```

## Cleanup

When done with a PubNub client, the client can be closed and cleaned up.

```dart

_client.dispose();

```
